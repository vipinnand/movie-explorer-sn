# Deployment Overview

This document provides a guide to deploy your **Movie Explorer App** in different environments: **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** and **Production**. We‚Äôll discuss recommended deployment architectures, CI/CD, environment management, and security.

## üåç Recommended Deployment Architecture

### 1. **Production Environment**

For production, we recommend using a **static file host** such as **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **AWS S3 + CloudFront**.

#### **Recommended Platforms:**

- **Netlify**: Easy continuous deployment from GitHub and excellent for single-page apps.
- **Vercel**: Automatically optimizes and deploys for production.
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Ideal for high scalability and security, but requires more manual setup.

### 2. **UAT Environment**

For UAT, you should deploy in a similar way to production but on a **staging subdomain** or a private URL where only QA or authorized users can access it for testing.

#### **UAT Deployment Options:**

- Use **Netlify/Vercel** for quick staging builds with different environment variables.
- **Docker containers** (if more complex, e.g., for API integration testing).

## üõ† CI/CD Recommendations

### 1. **Continuous Integration:**

- **GitHub Actions**: Set up a GitHub action for building and testing your app on push to `main` or a `release` branch.
- **CI Steps**:
  1. Install dependencies.
  2. Run tests using **Jest**.
  3. Lint and format code with **ESLint** and **Prettier**.
  4. Build the app using Webpack (either for UAT or production).

### 2. **Continuous Deployment:**

- **Netlify/Vercel**: Automatically deploy the latest version of your app with each push to `main` (or any other branch) on GitHub.
- **For S3**: Use a CI tool (like GitHub Actions) to upload built files to your S3 bucket.

#### Example GitHub Action for Deploying to Vercel:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build for Production
        run: npm run build:prod

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
```
