# Movie Explorer App

## Overview

The **Movie Explorer App** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and mark movies as favorites. It provides a clean, responsive UI built with **Material-UI (MUI)** and **Tailwind CSS**. The project demonstrates modern frontend development practices such as **Webpack**, **Vite**, **Jest**, and **ESLint**.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Fetch movies from the OMDB API.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about each movie.
- **Favorites**: Mark or unmark movies as favorites, which are stored in `localStorage`.
- **Responsive & Accessible UI**: The app is fully responsive and designed with accessibility in mind.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Install Dependencies

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-explorer.git
cd movie-explorer
npm install
```
````

### Set Up OMDB API Key

To fetch movie data from OMDB, you'll need to sign up for an **API key**:

1. Go to [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and create a free account.
2. Obtain your API key from the OMDB dashboard.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your **OMDB API Key**:

```plaintext
VITE_OMDB_API_KEY=your-omdb-api-key-here
```

This key is used to make API requests to fetch movie data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup

We use **Vite** for local development due to its fast build times and excellent developer experience.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view your app and see your changes immediately.

---

## üß© Webpack Configuration (UAT & Production)

In addition to **Vite** for development, **Webpack** is used for building **UAT** and **Production** environments. Webpack is configured to handle the build process, optimize bundles, and set up different environments (e.g., UAT, production).

### File Structure

Your Webpack configuration is split into modular files:

```
webpack/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webpack.common.js   # Shared configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webpack.dev.js      # Development (only for reference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webpack.uat.js      # UAT configuration (source maps enabled)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webpack.prod.js     # Production build (optimized, no source maps)
```

### Scripts

To run different build configurations, use the following scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",                           # Development server using Vite
  "build:uat": "webpack --config webpack/webpack.uat.js",   # Build for UAT environment
  "build:prod": "webpack --config webpack/webpack.prod.js"  # Build for production
}
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Testing

This project uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for unit and integration testing.

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in your app, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run all the tests located in the `src/__tests__` directory.

### Test Coverage

You can also check test coverage by running:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

---

## üßπ Linting & Formatting

This project uses **ESLint** (with Airbnb‚Äôs style guide) and **Prettier** to maintain consistent code style.

### Running the Linter

To manually run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Automatically Fixing Issues

To automatically fix any issues that the linter detects, run:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

---

## üèÅ Deployment

### Recommended Deployment Architecture

We recommend deploying the app to a static file hosting service. Here are a few options:

1. **Netlify**: For quick and automatic deployment with GitHub integration.
2. **Vercel**: Offers similar automatic deployment features as Netlify.
3. **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: For high scalability and security, if you prefer using AWS services.

### UAT Deployment

For UAT (User Acceptance Testing) deployments, you can use the same platforms, but deploy to a **staging** or **testing** subdomain for internal testing.

---

### CI/CD Recommendations

To automate the build and deployment process, use **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.

#### Example GitHub Action for Vercel:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build for Production
        run: npm run build:prod

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
```

### Deploy to S3/CloudFront (Optional)

For **AWS S3 + CloudFront**, use **GitHub Actions** or other CI/CD tools to upload the build files to an S3 bucket and configure **CloudFront** for distribution.

---

## Handling Environment Variables

For managing sensitive data such as the **OMDB API Key**, use environment variables.

### .env Files

Create different `.env` files for different environments:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.uat`
- `.env.production`

Here‚Äôs an example for the production `.env.production` file:

```plaintext
VITE_OMDB_API_KEY=your-production-api-key-here
VITE_API_URL=https://api.production.com
```

Make sure that sensitive keys are never committed to version control by adding `.env` files to `.gitignore`.

#### Secure Environment Variables in Vercel/Netlify

- **Vercel** and **Netlify** allow you to securely store your environment variables through their respective dashboards, keeping your sensitive data safe.

---

## üîÑ Switching Between Environments

You can build your app for different environments by using the Webpack configurations for UAT and Production.

### Running the UAT Build:

```bash
npm run build:uat
```

### Running the Production Build:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```
